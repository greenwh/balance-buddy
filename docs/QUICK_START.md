## Monthly Routine

### Reconciling Your Bank Statement

**What is reconciling?**
It's matching your register with your bank statement to make sure everything is correct.

**Easy Way (Recommended):**
1. Download your bank statement as CSV file
2. Click **"CSV"** button
3. Choose **"Auto Reconciliation"**
4. Click "Import CSV File"
5. Select your downloaded file
6. Review what it found
7. Click "Confirm Import"

✨ The app will:
- Match transactions automatically
- Mark matched ones as reconciled (✓)
- Add any you missed
- Tell you if amounts don't match

**What if something doesn't match?**
- Look for the transaction in your register
- Check if you entered it differently
- Make sure the amounts match
- Correct any mistakes

## Important Tips

### ✅ DO:
- Add transactions as soon as possible (while you remember!)

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I know which account I'm looking at?**
A: The button is highlighted in purple with a dark border.

**Q: What if I accidentally added a transaction to the wrong account?**
A: Delete it (click the red X), switch accounts, then add it again.

**Q: Can I undo a delete?**
A: No - that's why it asks "Are you sure?" Always double-check!

**Q: Why is my budget showing I spent more than I allowed?**
A: You went over budget in that category. Time to cut back!

**Q: What if my bank's CSV file doesn't work?**
A: Try adding transactions manually, or ask for help - we may need to add support for your bank.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: On your phone/computer only. It never goes to the internet.

**Q: What if I get a new phone?**

TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE FOR PARENTS:
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Problem: "I forgot which account I'm in"
Solution: Point to the purple button (that's the active one)

Problem: "I added a transaction to wrong account"  
Solution: Delete it (red X), switch accounts, add it again

Problem: "My budget is all red"
Solution: Review spending together, adjust budget or behavior

Problem: "CSV import didn't work"
Solution: Check if bank is supported (see csv_formats.txt)
          Try "Sync Mode" instead
          Add transactions manually if needed

Problem: "I can't find a transaction"
Solution: Check if it's in a different account
          Use Filter button to search
          Check date range in filter

Problem: "App won't open"
Solution: Clear browser cache
          Try different browser
          Re-deploy files

Problem: "I lost my data"
Solution: Check if backup JSON file exists
          Look in other accounts
          Check browser's IndexedDB (technical)

Problem: "I'm overwhelmed"
Solution: Simplify first:
          - Use just one account for now
          - Reduce budget categories to 3-4
          - Skip CSV import, manual entry only
          - Build complexity slowly


RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR:
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⚠️ Not using it at all
   → Revisit why it's helpful, simplify setup

⚠️ Many deleted transactions
   → May indicate confusion or frustration

⚠️ Wrong accounts consistently
   → Need more visual cues or simpler setup

⚠️ Budget always ignored
   → Amounts may be unrealistic or too strict

⚠️ Avoiding reconciliation
   → May be too complex, need more support

⚠️ Negative about money tracking
   → Address emotional component, not just technical
